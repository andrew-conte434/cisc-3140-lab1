# CISC 3140 Lab 1

<h2>Objective</h2>

Using AWK and Makefile, implement a data analysis workflow to parse data from a comma separated file and generate multiple reports

<h2>Content</h2>

<h4>Data.csv</h4>
This is a submodule, copied from <a href="https://gist.github.com/katychuang/d66a59b6db4e59c16efd4c42ad411f8e">THIS GIST</a> Which contains data on cars' makes, models, years, etc.

<h4>ranking.txt</h4>
This file is generated by 2 awk scripts, total.sh and rank.sh. Total.sh computes the total score for each car, and prints each car's id, year, make, model, and total score. This output is then sorted in the Makefile via a sort command. Rank.sh is then run the sorted list of cars, and generates a ranking for each of them, based on their score. 
 
<h4>top3.txt</h4>
The Makefile will sort ranking.txt with the following command: sort -t, -k4,4d -k1,1n. This sorts ranking.txt alphabetically by car make, and sorts each make internally by ranking. Top3.sh will then go through this sorted output, printing the first 3 cars of each make. 
  
 <h2>How to Run</h2>
 Running "make lab1" from the project's directory will create all necessary files
